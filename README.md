# Trishanku (त्रिशंकु)

Trishanku is an inexpensive collimation tester for optical alignment.
It costs less than 1 cent and is more versatile than shear plates.

Quick advantages:
- inexpensive
- works for both coherent and incoherent beams
- is compatible with optical posts
- works for random orientation beams 

All the details are in the Trishanku_manuscript.pdf file.
